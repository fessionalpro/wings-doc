# 9B5.Properties Binding

Lists common property binding in ConfigurationProperties.

Refer to [Type-safe Configuration Properties](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/3.0.3/reference/htmlsingle/#features.external-config.typesafe-configuration-properties)

## 9B5.1.Pojo JavaBean

* Basic type fields, or use wrapper classes if null is need
* Empty constructors, and good getters/setters specification
* Setters can be omitted for the following types, which are not immutable
  - Map, new is recommended, emptyMap is available, null is not recommended
  - Collection, new is recommended, emptySet is available, null is not recommended
  - Array, new is recommended, null is not recommended
  - nested POJO, new is recommended, null is not recommended
* null is not recommended because wings advocate NotNull and the default value
* @ConstructorBinding is not recommended

## 9B5.2.Config 3rd Class

Classes that are not able or convenient to directly @ConfigurationProperties, with @Bean annotation.

```java
@Bean
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "another")
public AnotherComponent anotherComponent() {
    return new AnotherComponent();
}
```

## 9B5.3.Property Key Style

Although Spring supports lax matching, for example,

* kebab - my.main-project.person.first-name
* camel - my.main-project.person.firstName
* underscore - my.main-project.person.first_name
* UPPER - MY_MAINPROJECT_PERSON_FIRSTNAME

In Wings, it is recommended to use all lowercase kebab for the config in properties.
But for environment variables use all-caps UPPER.

The rules for environment variables are: ① replace `. `, ② remove `-`, ③ all-caps

* `spring.main.log-startup-info` - `SPRING_MAIN_LOGSTARTUPINFO`
* `my.service[0].other` - `MY_SERVICE_0_OTHER`

## 9B5.4.Map Key Style

Bind property `my.map` to the `Map<String,String>`, with the following key naming,

* `key1` - `my.map.key1=value1`
* `/key2` - `my.map.[/key2]=value2`
* `key3` - `my.map./key3=value3`
* `a.b` - `my.map.a.b=value4`

Spring supports `scalar` values, including `enum`, `java.lang.*` (except for Object), and
You can omit `[]`, eg. in the `a.b`, and `spring.mail.properties.mail.debug`.

But Wings recommends

* keys that are not easily confused can be used directly, otherwise it is recommended to use `[]`
* within the spring system, follow the spring style, eg. spring.mail

## 9B5.5.Merge or Overwrite Prop

If properties come from multiple config files, collections are completely overwritten and
key-value pairs are merged by key

* Array/List/Set - do not merge, completely overwrite the contents with appearance priority
* Map/Pojo - merge, overwrite value by key with appearance priority

## 9B5.6.Duration and Period

Spring can handle java.time.Duration and Period with `all lowercase` units

* `@DurationUnit` milliseconds by default
* `us` - microseconds
* `ms` - milliseconds, `PT0.5S` equals `500ms`
* `s` - seconds
* `m` - minutes
* `h` - hours
* `d` - days

* `@PeriodUnit` days by default
* `y` - years
* `m` - months
* `w` - weeks
* `d` - days

## 9B5.7.DataSize

Units are `All Caps`

* `@DataSizeUnit` bytes by default
* 'B' - bytes
* 'KB' - kilobytes
* 'MB' - megabytes
* 'GB' - gigabytes
* 'TB' - terabytes

## 9B5.8.Differ from @Value

* @ConfigurationProperties - Relaxed binding, no SpEL support
* @Value - only `kebab` format can use Relaxed binding, support SpEL

Important, @Value does not support type-safe complex type injection in prefix style,
only single key and simple types.
