It is suitable for growing teams to smoothly achieve business growth, technology evolution, team pulling and business upgrading.
The core values are: ‚ë† quickly achieve business goals; ‚ë° timely repay technical debt; ‚ë¢ safely refactor programs and business.
For example, starting from a single app, to sharding, to micro service and to cloud, the team is able to:

* Rapidly refactor the business and its code, safely change the data models - strongly typed and defensive style
* Use git and sql to manage versioning of data and schema - Flywave tool (not Flyway)
* Trace, review and recover online data changes - logging system and tracing strategy

## üêµ Mindless Use

Use directly as a parent, occasional `SNAPSHOT` are available through OSS.

```xml
<parent>
    <groupId>pro.fessional</groupId>
    <artifactId>wings</artifactId>
    <version>${wings.version}</version>
</parent>
```

## ü¶Å Hands-on Use

It's recommended that you get your hands on the code to avoid low-level use and failure to achieve the original purpose, even if you have the potential to get it.

```bash
## (1) get source code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/\
trydofor/professional-wings.git
## (2) install dependency useing java8
# asdf shell java temurin-8.0.382+5
git submodule update --remote --init
(cd observe/meepo && mvn package install)
(cd observe/mirana && mvn package install)
## (3) install wings using java-21
# asdf shell java temurin-21.0.1+12.0.LTS
mvn package install
```
