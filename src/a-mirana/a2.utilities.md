## A2.E.`id/` Identity

### e1.LightId - Lightweight Distributed ID

Lightweight distributed primary key with double buffering,
using sequence to efficiently generate 64bit digital ID.
ID can guarantee strict `monotonic incremental` (ascending order),
but not continuous, and its long type 64bit composition is as follows.

* long = `1-bit:0 fixed`+`8-bit: Crc`+`1-bit: Layout`+`54-bit:Seq`
* `0 Fixed`, guarantee non-negative.
* `Crc`, `0` padding default, use Crc8Long to gen pseudo-random numbers.
* `Layout`, Provide `full sequence` and `block sequence` layouts.
  - `full sequence`=`1bit(0)` + `sequence(54bit)`
  - `block sequence`=`1bit(1)` + `block(9bit)` + `sequence(45bit)`
* `Seq`, Dependent on the layout, the following are its constraints
  - `block`=`block(9bit=512)`, distinguish different ID centers.
  - `sequence`=`sequence(45bit|54bit)`, The unique incremental number within `block`.
  - The Range of `block` is `[1,512]`, and `0` means `full sequence`

Since there are only 55 effective bits, the following characters are useful.

* ID centers, up to 512. Usually one data center with one ID center.
* Using 50k ID/s, ID can be used for 22 years, (2^45 - 1)/(365x24x3600x50,000) = 22.3
* In the case of the max-seq layout, the above capacity increase  512 times.
* The sequence is not time-based, so the limit and lifetime depend only on the ID consumer.
* The sequence is process independent, so it can generate different IDs in key-value form.

The default double-buffering implementation allows `Loader` to guarantee a unique ASC order, as well,

* guarantee the global block-name generates the unique ID.
* Intra-thread id ascending order, NO guaranteed for different threads.
* Async id fetch when the remaining reaches the threshold (80%), no lock (non-read/write lock)
* When switching ID segments, the minimum sync block is guaranteed for the protected resources.
* Dynamically adjust based on the speed of ID consumption , reserving 60 seconds of use.
* When the buffered ID are exhausted, only one Loader will load while others wait or timeout.
* Support manual preload of all available ids.
* Support manual or timed error clearing.
* Support manual adjustment of runtime parameters.

### e2.LightIdBufferedProvider - High performance, lightweight

Lightweight locking, high-performance, double-buffered light-id provider.

Measured performance is higher than busy-wait + read/write locks and big
sync block with combined locks. The bottleneck is on the IO of the loader,
which needs to be optimized for maxCount depending on the consumption.

There are 3 types of threads in total, and the read threads can be upgraded
to write threads and even to loader threads. At the same time, there are
multiple read threads, but only unique write threads and unique load threads.

* Read thread, normal light-id caller
* Write thread, read thread upgraded or load thread, append segment to buffer
* Load thread, async thread or read thread upgraded, loading segment via loader

The double buffering works as follows, which will track the id consumption
and automatically control the preload amount, but not exceed maxCount.

* If the remaining ID is less than 20%, the only async preload `maximum usage in 60s` or `maxCount`.
* If the ID is exhausted, the read thread is upgraded to the write thread and
  the other read threads wait until they are woken up or timed out
* If the read thread upgrades to the write thread, and there is a loader,
  this read thread will switch buffers after a spin busy waiting.

### e3.LightIdUtil - lightId as long number

Util to verify and convert lightId, long and sequence.
It can also change LightId's layout and seq order globally.

* forceBlockBit - adjust the bits count of `block`
* forceBlockFirst - which layout first, `Block` or `Sequence`

## A2.Q.`tk` Token and Ticket

Used for private key credentials that sometimes require central control and sometimes do not,
in the scenario between the meaningless session and the popular JWT system.

Session replication and sticky are very stable and widely used in horizontal extensions
such as redis and Hazelcast.

JsonWeb ecosystem is powerful in most data exchange and security requirements scenarios,
but the credential is its new domain.

The applicable scenarios are RememberMe or A credential to read the result of async tasks.

In RememberMe,  the biz-data can contain uid, while in sig-data the user secret and salt
must be checked against the ticket. the validation  must be evaluated when relogin,
password change, or credential expiration.

### q1.Ticket - Distributed credential with centralized authority

The features are short, expirable, kickable, sign-checkable, and have
some business meaning instead of meaningless random tokens.

Where the `Data` suffix is the business semantics, the `Part` suffix is
the transfer semantics, and the layout of different perspectives is,

* Business layout: SigData + `~` + SigPart
* SigData = PubPart + (`~` + BizData)?
* PubPart = `mod` + `-` + `due` + `-` + `seq`
* BizData: business data, such as plaintext Json
* Transfer layout: PubPart + `~` + SecPart
* SecPart = (BizPart + `~`)? + SigPart
* BizPart: encrypted BizData
* SigPart: signed data, sign the SigData
* `mod`: predefined pattern of encryption, signature and BizPart type for deserialization. English number
* `due`: expiration date, number of seconds from 1970-01-01, used to determine time expiration. Positive integer
* `seq`: serial number of issue, used to determine old and new, business expiration, positive integer
* `salt` - encryption or signature secret key, such as symmetric secret or asymmetric private key

The public part of business scenarios and descriptions  are as follows.

* `mod` The encryption and signature algorithms, data formats, user fields etc.
  are developed by the server or negotiated with the user
  - any = only parse text and merge fields
  - am0 = aes256(biz-data, salt) + md5(sig-data) Md5 without salt
  - am1 = aes256(biz-data, salt) + md5(sig-data + salt) Md5 with salt
  - ah1 = aes256(biz-data, salt) + HmacSha1(sig-data, salt) Hmac signature check
  - ah2 = aes256(biz-data, salt) + HmacSha256(sig-data, salt) Hmac signature check

* `due` The `seconds` from 1970-01-01 that the credential expires in, not milliseconds.
  - Expired credentials, the client must go to the server to renew
  - The server determines its own actions, such as renew, reject, resend, etc.

* `seq` Issue serial number. Increment when generating, and unchanged when renewing.
  if the seq is different, the credential must be reacquired.
  - When the user login, the credential is generated. When the other endpoint login again,
    the seq is incremented, then the old credentials can be kicked out.
  - When a credential expires without another login occurring,
    it can be renewed with seq for a new credential.
  - 0 means no need to verify serial number, generally used for weak privileges,
    such as temporary credentials

Credentials can be passed in the http header, session and url-string.

* Without the private key, you cannot verify the signature and decryption,
  and you can only use the PubPart information.
* With the private key, you can verify the credentials and obtain the
  business content through signature verification and decryption.
* If you don't have a private key and you need to check the signature,
  you can leave it unsalted and don't use hmac signature.

### q2.Default Implementation and Tool

* `AnyTicket` - Can parse tickets of any mod
* `TicketHelp` - basic tool for ticket parsing and verification
