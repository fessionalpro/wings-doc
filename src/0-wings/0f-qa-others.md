Uncategorized topics.

## 0F.01.Why is The Hero of Dota

I personally has bean loving to play dota with team, but now I don't even like to watch live streams.
Although there is a place in my heart called Dota.

* TI6, she's in Seattle, I'm in Delaware
* TI9, she's in Mercedes-Benz Arena, I'm in DaHongQiao

## 0F.02.Too Many typos in The Docs

If I had to find some reason, it would be

* The input method is not powerful, the candidate word prompt is crooked
* I am a science student, not good at language
* My brain is fast and my fingers can't keep up

## 0F.03.First Feature Makes Me Emo

Never before has a feature driven me to the point of feeling emo, the TinyTask is the first one, record it.

The need for this feature wasn't that strong, so I put it off for a long time. However,

* spring batch is a bit heavy
* xxl-job is currently not useful
* @Scheduled couldn't be cancelled or controlled for concurrency

I decided to design the basic architecture for TinyTask slowly. However, when it came to handling misfire and concurrency,
I was positive man of COVID-19. My brain works badly and I got stuck in a mind loop, unable to find a way out.

At that moment, I felt hopeless and regretted starting this feature. Eventually, I removed Misfire and
simplified the concurrency control, my COVID got better, my mind got better too.
However, when I tried to write the TinyTask docs, I felt a little empty inside, that is my broken down place.

Currently, the design of TinyTask is quite a stretch and is just an improved version of @Scheduled.
